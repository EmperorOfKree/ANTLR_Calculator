## Editing this project
1. For this, I'd sujest you to download the PyCharm and [configure it](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/setting-up-your-project.html)
2. With PyCharm (IntelliJ), it's a lot easier to work with ANTLR. Just follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svEZtRjVBTY) and [this])(https://youtu.be/dPWWcH5uM0g) tutorials and you're good to go!
  2.1. Yes, the tutorials are for IntelliJ+JAVA, but the configurations are the same to use it with PyCharm+Python.
